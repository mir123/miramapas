Between December 2023 and June 2024, we were researching migration in Panama through the Darién jungle. Hired by an international organization, Almanaque Azul and the GeoIndígena group conducted several trips to the communities of Bajo Chiquito and Canaan in the Emberá-Wounaan Comarca to study the challenges they faced due to the situation.

In 2023, over half a million people entered and exited from Colombia, crossing through what they call the "Darién Gap," heading towards Costa Rica, with almost everyone intending to reach the United States. The vast majority of those who passed through here were Venezuelans: the number skyrocketed when Mexico started requiring them to obtain a visa.

On average, 2,000 people arrived daily in Bajo Chiquito, and slightly fewer in Canaan. This heavily disrupted the lives of the people in those communities. The purpose of the work was to understand what was changing, what problems and opportunities the locals were facing, and at the same time, to analyze the relationship between the migrants and the locals. We interviewed dozens of migrants and humanitarian workers, and we held several meetings with community members.

What we found was an overwhelming sense of humanity and solidarity from the communities of the Emberá-Wounaan Comarca. We saw people who showed great sensitivity to a very peculiar situation. Many children, families, and individuals were fed for free; we saw how rescue teams were sent out when people were stranded in the jungle, and overall, migrants were treated very kindly.

The idea to create these maps came from the workshops we held with the people of Bajo Chiquito and Canaan. They wanted two things: for the migrants to know they had arrived in the Emberá-Wounaan Comarca in Panama and to help them orient themselves in the town and see where things were located.

The welcome message on the map is in Emberá, the language of the communities of Canaan and Bajo Chiquito; then in the most common languages of the migrants: Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Somali, Hindi, Pashto, English, and Simplified Chinese.

Apart from the welcome, the design of the map, which was refined by our long-time colleague Marilaura Cajar, was intended to work as non-verbally as possible and to ensure that the information flowed easily to people who found themselves in a strange and difficult situation.

In the map of Bajo Chiquito, I follow the principle of placing the body of water at the bottom. I learned long ago in my work with participatory mapping that people living by water (river, sea, or lake) find maps more natural with the water at the bottom. This was true here as well.

The original idea was to print the maps in large format to place them in the center of the town so that migrants could see them upon arrival. But shortly before completing the project, a conflict arose between the international organization Médecins Sans Frontières and the Panamanian government at that time. The Minister of Foreign Affairs accused NGOs of "handing out maps" to migrants in Colombia. Suddenly, maps for migrants became a sensitive topic, and the donor decided to distribute the maps to community members in letter size.
