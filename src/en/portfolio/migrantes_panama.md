Between December 2023 and June 2024, we conducted research on migration in Panama through the Darién rainforest. My collective, Almanaque Azul, in association with GeoIndigena, was hired for this mission by the United Nations Development Programme (see credits below). From 2023 to 2024, we made several trips to the communities of Bajo Chiquito and Canaan in the Emberá-Wounaan Comarca to study the challenges they faced due to the extreme situation in which they found themselves, where thousands of people passed through their communities daily on their way to the United States.

In 2023, over half a million people left Colombia, crossing through what is known as the "Darién Gap." Their first stop, after several days of walking through the jungle, was these two communities, which are located within an autonomous indigenous territory in Panama. The vast majority of those who passed through here were Venezuelans: the number surged when Mexico began requiring them to have a visa.

Every day, an average of 2,000 people arrived in Bajo Chiquito, and slightly fewer in Canaan. This greatly disrupted the lives of the people in these communities. The purpose of the work was to understand what was changing, what problems and opportunities the people there were facing, and at the same time, to analyze the relationship between the migrants and the locals. We interviewed dozens of migrants and humanitarian workers and held several meetings with the people of the community.

What we found was overwhelming humanity and solidarity from the communities in the Emberá-Wounaan Comarca. We saw people who demonstrated great sensitivity to a very unique situation. Many children, families, and individuals were fed for free; we witnessed rescue teams being sent when people were stranded in the jungle, and in general, migrants were treated with great kindness.

During the workshops with the people of Bajo Chiquito and Canaan, the idea came up to make a public map of the village. They wanted two things: for the migrants to know that they had arrived in the Emberá-Wounaan Comarca in Panama and to be able to orient themselves in the village and see where things were located. The idea was to print the maps on large vinyl (3 m wide) and place them in the center of each village.

I drew the base map using a drone ortho-photo taken by the colleagues from GeoIndigena. During one of the visits to the communities, I recorded the key points, such as the health center, the dock where the migrants arrived, and the restaurants. With that information, I created a basic map that we later reviewed, corrected, and validated in a workshop with the community.

The welcome greeting on the map is in Emberá, the language spoken in Canaan and Bajo Chiquito; then there are the most common languages of the migrants: Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Somali, Hindi, Pashto, English, and Simplified Chinese.

Apart from serving to welcome visitors, the design of the map, which was refined by our colleague designer Marilaura Cajar, was intended to work as much as possible non-verbally so that the information could easily flow to people in a strange and difficult situation.

On the map of Bajo Chiquito, I followed the principle of placing the body of water at the bottom. I learned some time ago in my participatory cartography work that people living by the water (river, sea, or lake) find it more natural for the map to have the water at the bottom. This was true here as well.
